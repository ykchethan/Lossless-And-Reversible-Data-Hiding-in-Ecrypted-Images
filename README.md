"# Lossless-And-Reversible-Data-Hiding-in-Ecrypted-Images" 
This project focuses on hiding encrypted data in the image and then sending the image through any network to the receiver as the message is encrypted and is useless if accessed by an eveâ€™s dropper. The image can then be decoded by the receiver using the same software used for encoding using the Lossless and Reversible Data Hiding scheme.
